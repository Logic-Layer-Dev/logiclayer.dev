# Portfolio v5 ![deployment](https://github.com/nuIIpointerexception/www.seekvisualartist.com/actions/workflows/nextjs.yml/badge.svg)

This is the fifth iteration of my portfolio website. It is built with Next.js, React and Tailwind CSS.

I wanted to try out a simplistic glassmorphism-like design.

It mainly presents my work as a visual artist and my skills as a web developer.
